# Mpping Khayelitsha

## Context

Khayelitsha is a peri-urban township situated on the outskirts of Cape Town. The most recent [**census**](http://resource.capetown.gov.za/documentcentre/Documents/Maps%20and%20statistics/2011_Census_CT_Suburb_Khayelitsha_Profile.pdf) was carried out in 2011 which reported a total of 64,761‬ informal structures. This outdated data does not accurately depict the current situation in Khayelitsha. This mapping project aims to add to the scantly available spatial analysis data by tracking the 'hot spots', or areas of high concentration, of informal structures and by providing percentages of formal and informal building footprints. Maps and numbers generated from the process will be used to identify the trend of change in informal structures since 2011. The knowledge acquired through spatial analysis can be used for further research into the driving force(s) of the changes in informal building footprint makeup.
