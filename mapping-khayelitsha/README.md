# mapping-khayelitsha

Khayelitsha is a peri-urban township situated on the outskirts of Cape Town. The most recent [**census**](http://resource.capetown.gov.za/documentcentre/Documents/Maps%20and%20statistics/2011_Census_CT_Suburb_Khayelitsha_Profile.pdf) was carried out in 2011 which reported a total number of 64,761‬ informal structures. The outdated data does not illustrate the current situation in Khayelitsha. This mapping project aims to add on the scant of spatial analysis data by tracking the hot spots of informal structures and providing percentages of formal/informal building footprints. Maps and numbers generated from the process will be used to identify the trend of change in informal structures. With this knowledge acquired through spatial analysis, people would be able to further dig into the driving force of the increasing/decreasing of informal building footprint makeup.
